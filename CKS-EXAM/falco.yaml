#We need to set the priority to alert and print the logs in a specific format
#Use below commands

--> #journalctl -fu falco
#grep -R "a shell was spawned" --> this will give us the location where the falco rule file is placed
#copy the existing content from the file and paste it under /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml

#modify the output field as per the format
 # output:>
 #    %evt.time,%user.uid,%container.id,%container.image.repository
#systemctl restart falco
#journalctl -fu falco
